This project has been migrated to .Net Standard, but by a HACK.

A connected service client has been generated by the new means. The interface changed and thus the calls into the client, as currently used in the WPF project.
But this turned out not to work, because of a shortcoming in Mono as described here:
https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/2463
I have kept this client for documentation and comparison purposes. But disabled it by using a different namespace.

I have copied and reused the old PCL client into this project, basically following a workaround as described here:
https://xamarin.github.io/bugzilla-archives/51/51959/bug.html
The Reference.cs would have been sufficient, but I copied it entirely for clarity. 
It may not be possible to simply update or reconfigure it the former way.

Later on I have hacked this client to get rid of redundant and inconsistent DTO classes (see the diffs).

Besides hoping for progress in Mono, a possible future solution may be to expand or transform the service for use by Web API.
In case of a full transormation that would affect all clients. Expanding or creating a parallel service would enable experimentation.
