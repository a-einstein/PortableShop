#### Aspects
* Xamarin Forms.
* MVVM.
* Client-server.
* WCF.
* Asynchronisity.
* Error handling.
* Globalized resources.
* Basic styling.
* Splash screen.
* Orientation.
* Custom controls.
* Extension.
* Behaviour.
* Application icon.
* ...

#### Prerequisites
* The application assumes the presence of my AdventureWorks, to which a service connection should be configured.
