#### Purpose
* Creating a working portable application for test and demo purpose based on Xamarin Forms.

#### Prerequisites
* The application assumes the presence of my [AdventureWorks services](https://github.com/a-einstein/AdventureWorks/blob/master/README.md), to which a service connection should be configured.

#### Notes
* This is a near equivalent of my [WpfShop](https://github.com/a-einstein/WpfShop).
* Currently this is only tested on Android API 21, and no longer suited for all platforms anyway.
* This project is available as an installable apk for Android in [releases](https://github.com/a-einstein/PortableShop/releases)
* For the time being the configured data service is only incidentally available. It may be made available on Azure again in the future. However, one can also install a own service. 

#### Aspects
* Xamarin Forms.
* C# + XAML.
* MVVM.
* Make use of an Azure service.
* Client-server.
* WCF + SSL.
* Asynchronisity.
* Error handling.
* Globalized resources.
* Basic styling.
* Splash screen (Android).
* Orientation.
* Custom controls.
* Extension.
* Behaviour.
* Application icon (Android).
