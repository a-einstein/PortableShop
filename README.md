## PortableShop

#### Description
Working desktop application for test and demo purpose based on Xamarin Forms. It simulates limited shopping capabilities based on the AdventureWorks database. It can be installed plug & play (see **Installation**).

#### News
This project is now integrated with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) too.

#### Purpose
* Explore various techniques based on C# and XAML.
* Manage the code and releases by Git and GitHub.
* Explore continuous integration by using combinations of Git, GitHub, TeamCity and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).
* Explore Scrum process management by integration with Jira and Visual Studio Team Services.

#### Prerequisites
* The application must be configured for a running instance of my [AdventureWorks services](https://github.com/a-einstein/AdventureWorks/blob/master/README.md).
* Currently this is met by configuration to my service on Azure.

#### Notes
* This is a near equivalent of my [WpfShop](https://github.com/a-einstein/WpfShop).
* Currently this is only tested on Android API 21, and no longer suited for all platforms anyway.
* Submitted to code analysis by **[Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com)**. Current score: [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/a-einstein/PortableShop)](https://bettercodehub.com)
