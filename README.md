#### News
This application is now plug & play.
* It can be installed directly on Android as an APK from [releases](https://github.com/a-einstein/PortableShop/releases).
* It uses my data service permanently running on Azure.

#### Purpose
* Creating a working portable application for test and demo purpose based on Xamarin Forms.

#### Prerequisites
* The application must be configured for a running instance of my [AdventureWorks services](https://github.com/a-einstein/AdventureWorks/blob/master/README.md).
